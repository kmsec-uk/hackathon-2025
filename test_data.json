    "summary": "LF Edge eKuiper Vulnerable to Stored XSS in Configuration Key Functionality",
    "description": "### Summary\nStored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web applications, which can then be executed in the context of other users' browsers. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, session hijacking, and spreading of malware, impacting user data privacy and application integrity.\n\n### Details\nA user with rights to modificate the service (e.g. kuiperUser role) can inject XSS Payload into Connection Configuration key `Name` (`confKey`) parameter. Then, after any user with access to this service (e.g. admin) will try to delete this key, a payload will act in victim's browser.\n\n### PoC\n1. Authorize as a user with rights to modificate the service (e.g. kuiperUser role).\n2. Create a service or go to the existing one and access the *Configuration > Connection* page:\n\n![*Configuration > Connection page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d29cbc23-04a4-4a49-bbd9-b26f74282c5c)\n\n3. Open any existing Connection and press on `Add configuration key`:\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/623dc76a-076c-41be-98d7-8fd42ed4e8fd)\n\n4. Set any name and Address, then intercept the request and add the following payload to the `confKey` parameter: `123%3Cimg%20src=1%20onerror%3dalert%281%29%3E`:\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/405000db-ace9-4bca-ac52-7dc44c54a0ae)\n\n5. A new configuration key then will be set: \n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43b75f1e-81ac-4815-9250-c1a0707827d3)\n\n6. *(Optional)* You can authorize another user with access to this service. For nexe steps I will use admin user\n7. After we push on delete button (trash icon) opposite the created connection, the payload will work:\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05a38899-343b-4f76-b6c7-8e27587e3cdf)\n\n\n### Impact\nStored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability\n\nReported by Alexey Kosmachev, Lead Pentester from Bi.Zone",

    "description": "### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability allows an attacker who controls content on the target site, or on a subdomain of the target site (either via XSS, or otherwise) to bypass Cross-Site Request Forgery checks and issue requests on user's behalf.\n\n### Details\n\nDue to misuse of the Go `net/http` library, nosurf categorizes all incoming requests as plain-text HTTP requests, in which case the `Referer` header is not checked to have the same origin as the target webpage.\n\nIf the attacker has control over HTML contents on either the target website (e.g. `example.com`), or on a website hosted on a subdomain of the target (e.g. `attacker.example.com`), they will also be able to manipulate cookies set for the target website. By acquiring the secret CSRF token from the cookie, or overriding the cookie with a new token known to the attacker, `attacker.example.com` is able to craft cross-site requests to `example.com`. \n\n### Patches\n\nA patch for the issue was released in nosurf 1.2.0.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIn lieu of upgrading to a patched version of nosurf, users may additionally use another HTTP middleware to ensure that a non-safe HTTP request is coming from the same origin (e.g. by requiring a `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin` header in the request).\n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rq77-p4h8-4crw\nhttps://github.com/justinas/nosurf-cve-2025-46721\nhttps://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46721\nhttps://github.com/justinas/nosurf/releases/tag/v1.2.0",

As OPKSSH depends on the OpenPubkey library for authentication, this vulnerability in OpenPubkey also applies to OPKSSH versions prior to 0.5.0 and would allow an attacker to bypass OPKSSH authentication.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability does not exist in more recent versions of OPKSSH. his only impacts OPKSSH  when used to verify ssh keys on a server, the OPKSSH client is unaffected. To remediate upgrade to a version of OPKSSH v0.5.0 or greater.\n\nTo determine if you are vulnerable run on your server:\n\n```bash\nopkssh --version\n```\n\nIf the version is less than 0.5.0 you should upgrade. To upgrade to the latest version run:\n\n```bash\nwget -qO- \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openpubkey/opkssh/main/scripts/install-linux.sh\" | sudo bash\n``` \n\n\n### References\n\n[CVE-2025-4658](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4658)\n\nThe upstream vulnerability in OpenPubkey is [CVE-2025-3757](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3757) and has the security advisory https://github.com/openpubkey/openpubkey/security/advisories/GHSA-537f-gxgm-3jjq",

This doesn't happen with the original sudo.\n\n### PoC\n\nThe initial test has been done in a container running Ubuntu 24.04 and installing [oxidizr](https://github.com/jnsgruk/oxidizr), running sudo-rs 0.2.2.\n\nA user (bob) has been added with only ps command executable through sudo:\n\n```\nroot    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\nbob     ALL=(ALL:ALL) /usr/bin/ps\n```\n\nThe user is not able to read the `/etc/sudoers` file and running `sudo -l -Uroot` with original sudo (version 1.9.15p5) causes the following error:\n\n```\nSorry, user bob is not allowed to execute 'list' as root on 43d4aed3cdbd.\n```\n\nThe same command with sudo-rs is run without denying the execution:\n\n```\nUser root may run the following commands on 43d4aed3cdbd:\n    (ALL : ALL) ALL\n```\n\nThe same happens for other non-root users:\n\n```\nbob@43d4aed3cdbd:~$ sudo -l -Ufoo\nUser foo may run the following commands on 43d4aed3cdbd:\n    (ALL : ALL) /usr/bin/whoami\n```\n\nThe behavior has been also been observed for version 0.2.5.\n\n### Impact\nUsers with limited sudo privileges can enumerate the sudoers file, revealing sensitive information about other users' permissions. Attackers can collect information that can be used to more targeted attacks.\n\nSystems where users either do not have sudo privileges or have the ability to run all commands as root through sudo (the default configuration on most systems) are not affected by this advisory.\n\n### Credits\nThis issue was identified by [Sonia Zorba](https://www.zonia3000.net/).",

    "summary": "Kirby vulnerable to path traversal of snippet names in the `snippet()` helper",
    "description": "### TL;DR\n\nThis vulnerability affects all Kirby sites that use the `snippet()` helper or `$kirby->snippet()` method with a dynamic snippet name (such as a snippet name that depends on request or user data).\n\nSites that only use fixed calls to the `snippet()` helper/`$kirby->snippet()` method (i.e. calls with a simple string for the snippet name) are *not* affected.\n\n----\n\n### Introduction\n\nKirby's `snippet()` helper and `$kirby->snippet()` method (in the following abbreviated to the `snippet()` helper) allow to load PHP snippet files that are normally stored in the `site/snippets` folder or registered by plugins through the `snippets` plugin extension.\n\nIf the `snippet()` helper is called with an arbitrary snippet name, Kirby first checks if a file with this name exists in the snippets root (which defaults to `site/snippets`).\n\nThis logic was vulnerable against path traversal attacks. By using special elements such as `..` and `/` separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the `../` sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location.\n\nBecause Kirby's `snippet()` helper did not protect against path traversal, the provided snippet name could include special sequences that would cause Kirby to look outside of the configured snippets root and access arbitrary files.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe missing path traversal check allowed attackers to navigate and access all files on the server that were accessible to the PHP process, including files outside of the snippets root or even outside of the Kirby installation. PHP code within such files was executed.\n\nSuch attacks first require an attack vector in the site code that is caused by dynamic snippet names, such as `snippet('tags-' . get('tags'))`. It generally also requires knowledge of the site structure and the server's file system by the attacker, although it can be possible to find vulnerable setups through automated methods such as fuzzing.\n\nIn a vulnerable setup, this could cause damage to the confidentiality and integrity of the server, for example:\n\n- it could allow the attacker to build a map of the server's file system for subsequent attacks,\n- it could allow access to configuration files that may contain sensitive information like security tokens or\n- it could cause the unintended execution of PHP scripts.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been patched in [Kirby 3.9.8.3](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.9.8.3), [Kirby 3.10.1.2](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.10.1.2) and [Kirby 4.7.1](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/4.7.1). Please update to one of these or a [later version](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases) to fix the vulnerability.\n\nIn all of the mentioned releases, we have added a check for the snippet path that ensures that the resulting path is contained within the configured snippets root. Snippet paths that point outside of the snippets root will not be loaded.\n\n### Effects on site code\n\nIf you deliberately use path traversal in your projects, these uses will break after updating to one of the patched versions.\n\nExamples of such uses include:\n\n- Aliasing a template by loading another template with `snippet('../templates/other-template')`. Robust alternatives are to use `require __DIR__ . '/other-template.php'` or to override the `$page->template()` method in the page model:\n  ```php\n  class AnotherPage extends Page\n  {\n    public function template(): Template\n    {\n      return $this->kirby()->template('other-template');\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n- Loading a snippet from a shared directory in a multisite setup. A robust alternative is to restructure the project so that all sites share a single snippets root that then branches off into subdirectories for each site. If you prefer to keep the original structure, you can use symbolic links (symlinks) in the file system to include the shared directory in the site-specific snippets roots.\n\n### Credits\n\nThanks to Bruno Meilick (@bnomei) for reporting the identified issue.\nThanks to Bruno Meilick and Tobias Möritz (@tobimori) for their input on the effects on site code.",

This leads to a different response that allows attackers to determine whether the requested file exists.\n\nBecause Kirby's router only delegates such requests to PHP and does not load or execute them, contents of the files were not exposed as PHP treats requests to files outside of the document root as invalid.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been patched in [Kirby 3.9.8.3](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.9.8.3), [Kirby 3.10.1.2](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.10.1.2) and [Kirby 4.7.1](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/4.7.1).

    "summary": "Kirby vulnerable to path traversal of collection names during file system lookup",
    "description": "### TL;DR\n\nThis vulnerability affects all Kirby sites that use the `collection()` helper or `$kirby->collection()` method with a dynamic collection name (such as a collection name that depends on request or user data).\n\nSites that only use fixed calls to the `collection()` helper/`$kirby->collection()` method (i.e. calls with a simple string for the collection name) are *not* affected.\n\n----\n\n### Introduction\n\nKirby's `collection()` helper and `$kirby->collection()` method (in the following abbreviated to the `collection()` helper) allow to load PHP logic files that are normally stored in the `site/collections` folder or registered by plugins through the `collections` plugin extension.\n\nIf the `collection()` helper is called with an arbitrary collection name, Kirby first checks if a file with this name exists in the collections root (which defaults to `site/collections`).\n\nThis logic was vulnerable against path traversal attacks. By using special elements such as `..` and `/` separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the `../` sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location.\n\nBecause Kirby's `collection()` helper did not protect against path traversal, the provided collection name could include special sequences that would cause Kirby to look outside of the configured collections root and access arbitrary files.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe missing path traversal check allowed attackers to navigate and access all files on the server that were accessible to the PHP process, including files outside of the collections root or even outside of the Kirby installation. PHP code within such files was executed.\n\nSuch attacks first require an attack vector in the site code that is caused by dynamic collection names, such as `collection('tags-' . get('tags'))`. It generally also requires knowledge of the site structure and the server's file system by the attacker, although it can be possible to find vulnerable setups through automated methods such as fuzzing.\n\nIn a vulnerable setup, this could cause damage to the confidentiality and integrity of the server, for example:\n\n- it could allow the attacker to build a map of the server's file system for subsequent attacks,\n- it could allow access to configuration files that may contain sensitive information like security tokens or\n- it could cause the unintended execution of PHP scripts.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been patched in [Kirby 3.9.8.3](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.9.8.3), [Kirby 3.10.1.2](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.10.1.2) and [Kirby 4.7.1](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/4.7.1). Please update to one of these or a [later version](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases) to fix the vulnerability.\n\nIn all of the mentioned releases, we have added a check for the collection path that ensures that the resulting path is contained within the configured collections root. Collection paths that point outside of the collections root will not be loaded.",
